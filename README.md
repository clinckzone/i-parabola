# iParabola

## About

This sketch draws its inspiration from "Parabolic string art". Where the parabola is visualized as an entity entirely made up of finite lengths of line segments. The shape of the parabola is controlled using three yellow circles on the screen, which are called as its- "control points". These "control points" when selected and moved with the help of mouse allows the user to make a parabola of any shape and size. There are three more functionalities provided in the sketch using which you can - set the stroke width of the parabolic curve, set the detail level of the curve (i.e.- How closely you want the visualization to resemble the actual curve?) and finally you can hide/show the grid of line segments from which it has been constructed.
